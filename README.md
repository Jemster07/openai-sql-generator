# OpenAI SQL Query Generator

### **ON HOLD!**
This project is on hold until I can acquire tokens to conduct proper testing.

## About
The initial framework for this app was created using [this tutorial.](https://youtu.be/kjUSOa_KOts?si=TniH4UaR0B46oYEJ) A simple front-end interface allows the user to generate SQL queries using natural language. The user's request is processed and sent to OpenAI's Chat Completions API endpoint. The supplied answer is then returned and displayed to the user.

## Technologies Used:
- Node.js (Back-end/Server)
- React (Front-end/Client)
- JavaScript
- Express
- OpenAI SDK
